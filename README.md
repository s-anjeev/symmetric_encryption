# Encryption and Decryption Script

This script demonstrates a simple implementation of data encryption and decryption using the Fernet symmetric key encryption provided by the `cryptography` library in Python.

## Features

- **Key Generation:** The script generates a Fernet key for encryption and decryption.
- **Data Encryption:** Encrypts a user-specified message using the generated key.
- **Data Decryption:** Decrypts the encrypted message using the same key.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system.
- Required Python packages installed:

    ```bash
    pip install cryptography
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the script.

## Optional Configuration

- **Logging:** The script uses the `logging` module for error handling. You can configure the logging level in the script for more or less detailed output.
